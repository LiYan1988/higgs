1. On the forum it seems that feature engineering is not very useful in increasing AMS.
2. EXT: 3.344
3. CV ensemble EXT: 3.335
4. XGBoost works very well: max_depth = 6, eta = 0.1, n_roungs = 120: AMS = 3.63302
5. CV ensemble + xgboost, 10 repetition, 2 fold cv, xgboost parameters are the same as (4): AMS = 3.64216
6. XGBoost: eta = 0.01, max_depth = 9, sub_sample = 0.9, num_rounds = 3000: AMS = 3.67944
7. Increase the number of folds in CV ensemble works: 3 fold 10 repitition CV ensemble with xgboost, AMS = 3.72067
8. CV ensemble + other models
